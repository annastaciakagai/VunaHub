# VunaHub 


#### MERN Stack Evaluation.
VunaHub’s use of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) enables full stack JavaScript development, faster iteration. React (web frontend) is flexible for interactive dashboards (e.g. tracking shipments, orders), and Node/Mongo can scale horizontally on cloud servers. MongoDB’s schema-less design suits evolving data models (farmers, vehicles, orders). 
Each directory and file serves a clear role: the frontend collects user input and displays maps/notifications, while the backend implements business logic and integrates external services. This structure keeps code organized and scalable, enabling easy maintenance and feature additions as VunaHub grows.
